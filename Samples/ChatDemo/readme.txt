This is the most basic sample. It illustrates the process of a client connecting to the server. Then joining a room and exchanging chat messages with others in the room. The sample illustrates the use of HTML5 and Corona on the client side. On the server side we extend the room logic through by implementing an extension of BaseRoomAdaptor. The extension will filter chat messages by checking against a list of banned words and not broadcasting them.
