This is an MMO sample with a 2D Map. Clients connect and join an admin room. Once inside the room, players collect powers and bullets. There is also a server controlled dragon which the clients have to kill. This sample illustrates the use of room properties, server side game loop (timer tick) and chat messaging to communicate player positions. The sample also illustrates the use of Flash on the client side.
