Introduction
===============

* AppWarp S2 is the on premise authoritative server alternate to our popular AppWarp cloud offering.

* AppWarp cloud is great for a variety of realtime multiplayer games like side-scrolling, action combat, realtime turn based games etc. However in many cases such as MMOs, dealer based cards games etc. a **custom authoritative server** is desired. AppWarp S2 is the solution for such scenarios. Applications built on top of AppWarp S2 are easy to build and deploy on any Java supported system.

* AppWarp S2 also comes with a rich **admin tool** which allows developers to see the instance analytics and control its behavior.

* AppWarp S2 is an **easy to use extensible server**. It exposes a **server side SDK** through which developers can customize how request events are handled. 

* It allows developers to send custom messages and also exposes a **server side game loop** through which developers can generate custom messages from the server and send to clients. 

* Developers can **customize how client authentication** is done. The client SDK allows developers to add custom authentication data that is available on the server side when a connection request is received. On the server side, custom authentication logic can then be added.

* AppWarp S2 also allows **RPCs** to be performed on the server. From the client side its as easy as specifying the function name and parameters. On the server, the corresponding function is then invoked with the given parameters.
